# X Engojee - Automated X Engagement App

X Engojee is an Android application that automates user engagement on the X (formerly Twitter) platform using Android's Accessibility Service. The app identifies posts based on user-defined keywords and performs human-like interactions such as liking and commenting.

## Architecture

The application consists of three main components:

1. **React Native Frontend** - User-friendly control panel for managing rules and controlling the automation
2. **Native Android Module** - Bridge between React Native and the Accessibility Service
3. **Accessibility Service** - Core automation engine that reads screen content and performs actions

## Features

### âœ… Complete Implementation

- **Rule-Based Automation**: Create custom rules with keywords and replies
- **Human-Like Behavior**: Randomized delays, imperfect gestures, and probabilistic actions
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live activity logs and status updates
- **Accessibility Service**: Advanced UI parsing and gesture automation
- **Data Persistence**: AsyncStorage for rule management
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful React Native interface with proper UX

### ðŸŽ¯ Humanizer Features

- **Randomized Delays**: Variable timing between actions (2-4 seconds for scrolling, 1.5-3.5 seconds for reading)
- **Imperfect Gestures**: Random tap points within UI elements instead of precise centers
- **Probabilistic Actions**: 90% action probability, 70% comment vs like ratio
- **Natural Scrolling**: Variable scroll distances and speeds

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Android Studio
- Android SDK (API level 24 or higher)
- Physical Android device (recommended for testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd xengojee
   npm install
   ```

2. **Android Setup**
   ```bash
   # Build the Android app
   npx expo run:android
   ```

3. **Enable Accessibility Service**
   - Open the app
   - Tap "Enable Accessibility Service"
   - Find "X Engojee" in the accessibility services list
   - Enable the service

## Usage Guide

### 1. Creating Rules

1. Navigate to the "Rules" tab
2. Tap the "+" button to create a new rule
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Rule Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Crypto Replies")
   - **Keywords**: Comma-separated keywords (e.g., "bitcoin, crypto, blockchain")
   - **Replies**: One reply per line for random selection

### 2. Starting Automation

1. Go to the "Control" tab
2. Ensure you have at least one rule created
3. Toggle the service switch to "ON"
4. Open the X app
5. Monitor activity in the real-time log

### 3. Monitoring Activity

The Control tab shows:
- **Service Status**: Current automation state
- **Rules Summary**: Statistics about your rules
- **Activity Log**: Real-time updates of bot actions

## Technical Details

### Accessibility Service Configuration

```xml
<accessibility-service xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:accessibilityEventTypes="typeViewScrolled|typeWindowContentChanged|typeWindowStateChanged"
    android:packageNames="com.twitter.android"
    android:accessibilityFeedbackType="feedbackGeneric"
    android:notificationTimeout="100"
    android:canRetrieveWindowContent="true"
    android:canPerformGestures="true"
    android:settingsActivity="com.xengojee.MainActivity"
/>
```

Note: The app no longer declares `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` as a normal permission in the manifest/app.json. That permission is only used on the service declaration. Start/stop commands are delivered via a broadcast receiver and persisted pending start, so you can toggle automation even if the service isn't yet enabled; it will start automatically once you enable the accessibility service.

### Key Components

#### XEngojeeService.kt
- Main accessibility service implementation
- UI parsing and post identification
- Gesture automation with humanization
- Keyword matching and action execution

#### AutomationModule.kt
- React Native bridge module
- Service lifecycle management
- Event emission to JavaScript

#### AutomationService.js
- JavaScript bridge service
- Event listener management
- Promise-based API for React Native

## Security & Privacy

- **No API Keys Required**: Uses accessibility service instead of X API
- **Local Data Storage**: All rules stored locally on device
- **No Network Requests**: No data sent to external servers
- **Permission-Based**: Requires explicit accessibility permission

## Bot Detection Evasion

The app implements several techniques to avoid detection:

1. **Variable Timing**: Random delays between all actions
2. **Imperfect Interactions**: Random tap points within UI elements
3. **Probabilistic Behavior**: Doesn't act on every post (90% action rate)
4. **Natural Patterns**: Mixes comments and likes (70/30 ratio)
5. **Session Management**: Designed for finite automation sessions

## Development

### Building for Development

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npx expo start

# Run on Android device
npx expo run:android

# View logs
npx react-native log-android
```

### Debugging

1. **Android Studio Layout Inspector**: Inspect X app UI elements
2. **Logcat**: Monitor service logs with tag "XEngojeeService"
3. **React Native Debugger**: Debug JavaScript components

### Testing

Test the accessibility service with these steps:

1. Enable the service in Android settings
2. Open X app and scroll through timeline
3. Check Logcat for service activity
4. Verify actions are performed correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service Not Starting**
- Ensure accessibility service is enabled
- Check app permissions in Android settings
- Restart the app and try again

**No Posts Detected**
- Verify X app is the correct package (`com.twitter.android`)
- Check if X app UI has changed (may require service updates)
- Monitor Logcat for parsing errors

**Actions Not Working**
- Ensure gesture permissions are granted
- Check if UI elements have changed
- Verify random delays aren't too long

### Logs and Debugging

Check these log tags in Logcat:
- `XEngojeeService`: Accessibility service logs
- `AutomationModule`: React Native bridge logs
- `ReactNativeJS`: JavaScript console logs
